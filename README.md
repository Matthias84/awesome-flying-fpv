# Awesome Flying FPV [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

<!--lint disable awesome-toc no-repeat-punctuation match-punctuation -->

This is a list of Free Software and Open Hardware dedicated for multicopters as well as airplanes or flying wings. We list esp. established projects with a active community and also some classics that might be legacy but important projects with a lot of mods.

We hope to give you some orientation where to start and present you the full spectrum of open source development on the world of UAVs.

> **Warning**
> You as creator, mechanic, spotter and pilot **are responsible** for your drone and doing. It is on you to avoid damages and not to hurt any person or animal.
> You are also responsible to match the local regulations of your country and to know where and how to fly with a minimum risk to others and yourself.
> Please respect [good airmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airmanship).

> **Warning**
> In past and recent wars and **military conflicts**, parties make use of UAVs and sometimes DIY aircraft to spot and attack opponents.
> My intention on this technology is in opposite a peaceful research and learning on tech and nature, not on killing people! [stopkillerrobots.org](https://www.stopkillerrobots.org)

## Airframes

The body of a UAV depends on the kind of aircraft and is optimized for it's usecase. Is it high speed for racing, improved agility for acrobatic freestyle, a heavy lifter for filming , long distance observations, ... . This requirements result in different mechanics and materials and take DIY aspect into account.

You will find also a lot of spare parts or mods / extensions to commercial vehicles, which we don't list up here!

> **Note**
> Building a UAV from scratch is a **pretty challenging task** for a beginner, esp. if you have limited amount of time.
> So it might be wise, to try existing solutions or kits before, so you don't get stuck to early and have a handy manual. Later on, you can try different mods or start with custom builds, if you have gained more experience and know how to avoid common pitfalls.

### Fixed Wing / Planes üõ©Ô∏è

Traditional RC airplanes are created using balsa wood and foil covered rips for the wings. Commercial models make often use of foam, that you can also cut by CNC and lasers to create wing profiles.  Also fully 3D printed planes are possible, that you glue and strength with carbon roods. There is also a growing community for (commercial) 3D printed models like [Craycle Hobby](https://craycle.com/), [Eclipson airplanes](https://www.eclipson-airplanes.com/),[3D lab print](https://3dlabprint.com/product-category/printable-airplanes/), [Plane Print](https://www.planeprint.com/) , [OWLplane](https://owlplane.com/) or [rc-jetprint.de](https://rc-jetprint.de/en/) using lightweight PLA to save weight.

### Checklists üìã

Malfunction can have dramatic consequences, as well as your drone can cause massive damages. To avoid unnecessary risks, a step by step protocol and documentation is mandatory for every flight in case you might use your insurance.

#### build power check

#### maiden flight check

* [iNav Pre-maiden Checklist](https://www.mrd-rc.com/tutorials-tools-and-testing/flight-controller-therapy/inav-pre-maiden-checklist-a-helpful-reminder-and-saver-of-foam/) by Mr.D for fixed wing

#### regular flight check

* [Ardupilot Copter Checklist](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/checklist.html).

### ID Systems üõÇ

We share the airspace with other pilots. RC copters and planes are hard to spot, so it is recommend to share your position via transponder systems. This allows also tracking of illegal maneuvers.

* ADS-B transmitters of airplanes can be received using software defined radios can be realized using cheap USB DVB-T receivers. Can be integrated via radar extensions like [mwp-radar-view](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/wiki/mwp-Radar-View), [Ardupilot ADS-B receiver](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-ads-b-receiver.html) or in OpenHD.
